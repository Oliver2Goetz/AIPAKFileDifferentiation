# AIPAKFileDifferentiation
AIPAKFileDifferentiation is a program to display all the differences between two given PAK files for Alien Isolation. This includes creating, modifing and deleting items such as composites, entities, parameter and more.<br>
The goal of this project is to see the differences in a modded PAK file and the vanilla one. For example if a savestation has been added in a certain level it will be displayed as "CREATED" and the composite it is in.

#### This is how the window looks like:

## Libraries
This program uses the [CathodeLIB](https://github.com/OpenCAGE/CathodeLib) provided by [MattFiler](https://github.com/MattFiler) to read the content of PAK files.
